What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of hard-coded rules, ML models identify patterns and make predictions based on examples.

2. Types of Machine Learning
a. Supervised Learning

Model learns from labeled data.

Example: Predicting house prices from known examples.

b. Unsupervised Learning

Model finds patterns in unlabeled data.

Example: Clustering customers into groups.

c. Reinforcement Learning

Model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Example: Training a robot to walk.
